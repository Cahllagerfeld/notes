There are several Limits Vercel provides, when hosting the Application there. See the Limits in the first link of the Reference Section.

When opensourcing your project, you should pay attention, that not every PR coming from a Fork tirggers the [[Preview Environment]] Vercel deploys for you. If not configured properly, you might exceed the Limits quite fast.
