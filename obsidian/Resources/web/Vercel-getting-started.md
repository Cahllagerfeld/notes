Vercel is a platform for hosting frontends written in a diverse collection of frameworks and static sites. Vercel itself takes care of the actual deployment of the app and provides a production, as well as preview environments for Feature-Branches.
The appraoch is serverless, which means Vercel also scales your application depending on traffic it faces.
